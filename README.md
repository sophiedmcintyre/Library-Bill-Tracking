# Library Bill Tracking
This repository was built as part of a data protocol for LIS 546, Data Curation II. It is meant to house datasets of past and ongoing bills regarding the legislation of libraries and library staff. The full protocol can be found [here](https://lis-546.gitbook.io/library-bill-tracking/) on GitBook.

Examples from two states can be found in the Example-Datasets folder and a template for the metadata file can be found in the Supporting Documentation folder.

A fully complete submission containing bills from Oklahoma between the years 2022 and 2023 can be found in the Datasets folder.
