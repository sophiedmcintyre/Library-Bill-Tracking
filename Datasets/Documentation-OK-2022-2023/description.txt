This data set contains all bills pertaining to libraries and library staff from the Oklahoma State Legislature from the years 2022 to 2023. To collect this data, the researchers used the subject field for public libraries from the Oklahoma State Legislature's advanced bill search webpage (http://www.oklegislature.gov/AdvancedSearchForm.aspx). Once all relevant bills were found, data on each bill was pulled from LegiScan (https://legiscan.com/).
